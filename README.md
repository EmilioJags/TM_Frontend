# TMFront

In order to run this you need to do the following

1. Make sure the backend is up and running (backend code : https://github.com/EmilioJags/TM_Backend)
2. Once backend is up without errors, open this frontend code in visual studio
3. Open up a console (Ctrl + Shift + ~)
4. Type ng serve
5. If all goes well, you should be able to open up any browser window on localhost:4200 and use the application fully
